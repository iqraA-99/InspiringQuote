      <h2>Why this Inspires Me</h2>
      <p class="p-info">
        The phrase "Defying Gravity" is a reminder that limits are meant to be
        challenged. It speaks to anyone who has been told to stay in their
        place, to those who dream beyond expectations. We were never meant to
        stay on the ground. Dreams don't have to stay dreams.
